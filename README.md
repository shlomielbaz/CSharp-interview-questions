    A stack is a data structure that uses a principle called Last-In-First-Out (LIFO), meaning that the last object added to the stack      must be the first object removed from it.<br />
    At minimum, any stack should be able to perform the following three operations:<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Peek: Return the object at the top of the stack (without removing it).</li>
      <li>Push: Add an object passed as an argument to the top of the stack.</li>
      <li>Pop: Remove the object at the top of the stack and return it.</li>    
    </ul>
