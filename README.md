    <b>Super stack</b> - implement a stack that accepts the following commands and performs the operations described:<br />
    <ul>
      <li><i>push v</i>: Push integer <i>v</i> onto the top of the stack.</li>
      <li><i>pop</i>: Pop the top element from the stack.</li>
      <li><i>inc i v</i>: Add <i>v</i> to each of the bottom <i>i</i> elements of the stack.</li>
    </ul>
    After each operation, print the value at the top of the stack. if the stack is empty, print the string <i>EMPTY</i> <a href="https://github.com/shlomisderot/interview-questions/blob/master/super-stack.JPG">see an image illustration</a><br />

  <b>Alien Username</b> - In a galaxy far, far away, on a planet different from ours, each computer username uses the following format:<br />
  It must begin with either an underscore, _ (ASCII value ), or a period, . (ASCII value ).<br />
  The first character must be immediately followed by one or more digits in the range  through .<br />
  After some number of digits, there must be  or more English letters (uppercase and/or lowercase).<br />
  It may be terminated with an optional _ (ASCII value ). Note that if it's not terminated with an underscore, then there should be no characters after the sequence of  or more English letters.<br />
  Given  strings, determine which ones are valid alien usernames. If a string is a valid alien username, print VALID on a new line; otherwise, print INVALID. <a href="https://github.com/shlomisderot/interview-questions/blob/master/alien-username.png">see an image illustration</a><br />
